## 1.0 Problem Statement

1. **You are diabetic**: This is a direct classification result when the probability of the diabetic class is above a certain threshold, often 0.5 for binary classification. However, this threshold can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the model and the business or medical requirements.

2. **You are not Diabetic**: Similarly, this is another direct classification result when the probability of the non-diabetic class is above the threshold.

3. **You have x% risk to become diabetic**: This is essentially the probability value assigned by the model to the diabetic class for the given entry. For instance, if you input a patient's data into the model and it outputs a probability of 0.65 for the "diabetic" class, it can be interpreted as "This patient has a 65% risk of becoming diabetic."

**Using Selected/Best Model with Probabilities:**

Using the model to predict class probabilities using the `predict_proba` method. This will provide probabilities for each class, and in the context of a binary problem like yours, the output will have two columns: the first column represents the probability of the "non-diabetic" class, and the second represents the probability of the "diabetic" class.

**to utilize models to analyze diabetes and non diabetes patients to find out what are the leading causes for diabetes**



## 1.1 Features Being Used

Certainly! Here's a brief description of each feature:

1. **gender**: 
    - Represents the biological sex of the individual.
    - Typically categorized as "male," "female," or in some datasets, "other" or "non-binary."

2. **age**: 
    - Represents the age of the individual, usually measured in years.
    - Can be a continuous variable (e.g., 25.5 years) or discrete (e.g., 25 years).

3. **hypertension**: 
    - Indicates whether the individual has hypertension (high blood pressure).
    - It's usually a binary indicator: "yes" (or 1) for those with hypertension, and "no" (or 0) for those without.

4. **heart_disease**: 
    - Indicates whether the individual has any heart-related diseases.
    - Typically a binary feature: "yes" (or 1) for those with heart disease and "no" (or 0) for those without.

5. **smoking_history**: 
    - Describes the individual's history with smoking.
    - Can be categorical, with values such as "never smoked," "formerly smoked," "currently smoking," etc.

6. **bmi**: 
    - Stands for "Body Mass Index."
    - A measure used to determine whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height.
    - Calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. 
    - Used as an indicator of underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity.

7. **HbA1c_level**: 
    - Refers to the Hemoglobin A1c test.
    - Measures the average blood sugar (glucose) level over the past 2-3 months.
    - Used to diagnose diabetes and gauge how well someone is managing their diabetes.
    - Values are often presented as a percentage. A higher percentage can indicate higher blood glucose levels.

8. **blood_glucose_level**: 
    - Represents the concentration of glucose present in the blood.
    - Measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L).
    - A key indicator for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes.

Each of these features provides valuable health-related information. In the context of predicting or understanding diabetes, they are all relevant as they are associated with risk factors or direct indicators of diabetes.

### 1.2.0 Correlation Matrix 

<img src="images/corr.png">


Here's what we can infer from the correlation matrix:

 #### Age
- **Moderate positive correlation with BMI (0.34)**: As age increases, BMI also tends to increase.
- **Low positive correlations with hypertension (0.26), heart disease (0.24), and diabetes (0.26)**: Older people are more likely to have these conditions, but the correlation isn't very strong.
  
#### Hypertension
- **Low positive correlations with age (0.26), diabetes (0.20), and BMI (0.15)**: People with hypertension are slightly more likely to be older, diabetic, and have a higher BMI.
  
#### Heart Diseas
- **Low positive correlations with age (0.24) and diabetes (0.17)**: Older individuals and those with diabetes are slightly more likely to have heart disease.
  
#### BMI
- **Moderate positive correlation with age (0.34) and low positive correlation with diabetes (0.21)**: Higher BMI is more common in older individuals and those with diabetes.
  
#### HbA1c Level
- **Moderate positive correlation with diabetes (0.41)**: Higher levels of HbA1c are strongly associated with diabetes.
- **Low positive correlation with blood glucose level (0.17)**: Higher levels of HbA1c are somewhat associated with higher blood glucose levels.
  
#### Blood Glucose Level
- **Moderate positive correlation with diabetes (0.42)**: Higher blood glucose levels are strongly associated with diabetes.
- **Low positive correlation with HbA1c level (0.17)**: Higher blood glucose levels are somewhat associated with higher HbA1c levels.
  
#### Diabetes
- **Moderate positive correlation with HbA1c level (0.41) and blood glucose level (0.42)**: People with diabetes are likely to have higher levels of HbA1c and blood glucose.

To summarize, the strongest correlations we have are between diabetes and HbA1c levels, and between diabetes and blood glucose levels. These could be key features if we are looking to predict or understand diabetes in this dataset. Age and BMI also show moderate positive correlations with diabetes.


### 1.2.1 Age Analysis 

```python
count    96146.000000
mean        41.794326
std         22.462948
min          0.080000
25%         24.000000
50%         43.000000
75%         59.000000
max         80.000000
Name: age, dtype: float64
```

The average age across all the entries is approximately 41.79 years.

3. **std**: The standard deviation, which is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the set of values, is approximately 22.46 years. This suggests that most of the ages lie within 22.46 years above or below the mean age (41.79 years).

4. **min**: The youngest age in the dataset is 0.08 years, which is likely a baby of about a month old (around 29 days).

5. **25% (First Quartile)**: 25% of the people in the dataset are younger than 24 years. This is the age below which a quarter of the data falls.

6. **50% (Median)**: The median age, or the age at which half of the data points are above and half are below, is 43 years.

7. **75% (Third Quartile)**: 75% of the people in the dataset are younger than 59 years. This means that three-quarters of the data falls below this age, and one-quarter of the data is above it.

8. **max**: The oldest age in the dataset is 80 years.

* Statistical Testing For HbA1c Level For Both Diabetes And Non-Diabetes 

    ```python
    --------------------------------------------------
    t-statistic: 137.92
    p-value: 0.0
    Confidence interval: [1.51, 1.56]
    --------------------------------------------------
    ```
    The results suggest a very strong statistical difference between the two groups:

    - **t-statistic**: The t-statistic of approximately 138.28 is very high, which suggests a large difference in the   means of the two groups relative to the variability within the groups.

    - **p-value**: A p-value of 0.0 is indicative of the results being extremely statistically significant. This means  that the likelihood of observing such extreme differences in "HbA1c_level" between the two groups (one with  "diabetes" equal to 1 and the other with "diabetes" equal to 0) purely by chance is virtually zero.

    Given these results, we would reject the null hypothesis, which assumes that there's no difference between the two  groups. This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in "HbA1c_level" between the group with  "diabetes" equal to 1 and the group with "diabetes" equal to 0.

    The confidence interval we've calculated suggests that if the underlying population from which your samples are     drawn were subject to many additional samples, approximately 95% of those calculated intervals would contain the    true difference in means between the two populations.

    The 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean HbA1c levels between the two groups (one with diabetes and   one without) is \([1.5145, 1.5619]\).

    What this means is that we can be 95% confident that the true difference in average HbA1c levels between people     with diabetes and people without diabetes in the overall population will fall within this range.

    Given the p-value of \(0.0\) in our t-test and this confidence interval that doesn't contain zero, it's safe to say     that the difference in means is statistically significant. Therefore, we have strong evidence to conclude that the  average HbA1c levels are indeed different between the two groups.

* Statistical Testing for Blood Glucose Level 
    ```python 
    --------------------------------------------------
    t-statistic: 145.3

    --------------------------------------------------
    ```
    **Testing whether the mean blood glucose level differs between people with diabetes (`bg_diabetes`)     and those without diabetes (`bg_no_diabetes`).**

    ### t-statistic:

    The t-statistic is a measure of how many standard errors the sample means of the two groups are     apart. A larger absolute value of the t-statistic indicates that the difference between the means is    more significant.

    - **t-statistic: 146.16**: The t-statistic is very high, indicating that the means of blood glucose     levels in the two groups are significantly different from each other.

    ### p-value:

    The p-value is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis, which in this case is that    there's no difference between the two groups.

    - **p-value: 0.0**: A p-value of 0.0 means that the likelihood of observing such extreme differences    between the groups under the assumption that they are the same (the null hypothesis) is virtually  zero. 

    ### Summary:

    Given the high t-statistic and the p-value of nearly zero, we can confidently reject the null   hypothesis. This means that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean blood     glucose levels between people with diabetes and those without diabetes in your dataset.
